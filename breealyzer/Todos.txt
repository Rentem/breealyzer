 - Throw trashy drones into waste bin
 - Add Environment check (take environment into consideration when selecting Queen / Princess
 - Milk Queens until they die... (to create princesses)
 - Add breeding mode where a certain target species is set in the tree. breealyzer will try to achieve this with the given resources. if not achievable, display error (missing species / trait).
 - GUI in general.
 - remote apiaries using a VERY VERY expensive "dongle" (which will work as an apiary for the breealyzer - either on top or in line with apiaries)
 - recurring: Improve selection algorithm -  :)
