 - Throw trashy drones into waste bin
   - SeedBank has 5 Drones for each trait (using best trait value) 
   - differentiate seedBank and workchest (bestScores to workchest)
   - use SeedBank for Selection (and refill?)
   - clean SeedBank (purify for best value for each Trait)
   - 
 - Productive Mode (reuse drone & pricess without analysing) 
 - Add Environment check (take environment into consideration when selecting Queen / Princess) - Environment can be taken from the InventoryHandler.
 - Milk Queens until they die... (to create princesses)
 - Add breeding mode where a certain target species is set in the tree. breealyzer will try to achieve this with the given resources. if not achievable, display error (missing species / trait).
 - Breed all possible Bees
 - GUI in general.
 - remote apiaries using a VERY VERY expensive "dongle" (which will work as an apiary for the breealyzer - either on top or in line with apiaries)
 - energy/other stuff requirements 
 - speed up breeding/production for special materials (consuming)
 - recurring: Improve selection algorithm -  :)
 - Trash for unused Bees (nullyFier) or does other mod offer it?
